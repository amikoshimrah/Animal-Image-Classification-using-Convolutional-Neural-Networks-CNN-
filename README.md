# Animal-Image-Classification-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN-

This project demonstrates image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on the [Animals-10 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10).  

## Key Features
- Automatic dataset download using KaggleHub  
- Data preprocessing and augmentation with ImageDataGenerator  
- CNN model with convolutional, pooling, dropout, and batch normalization layers  
- Training with early stopping and learning rate scheduling  
- Performance evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report  
- Visualization of training metrics and predictions  

The model performance was not that good it around 78%.
i tried using transfer Learning -EfficientNetV2B0 and the performance was increased
